# SnapshotWithWinTitle
take snapshot and recoord the window's title as source link

# How it works
write a piece of HTML snippet to clipboard, within which  the snapshot image and where it takes is recoorded.  
So that when one paste the copied content to the editors or note applications, such as MS Word or Onenote, a hyperlink is appended after the clipped image.   
And this is helpful to figure out where the snapshot takes when reviewing.
